# Localization systems

This repository contains code snippets as well as datasets to be used in the UAB's course "GeodÃ¨sia i Sistemes de LocalitzaciÃ³" (GSL)

Start here ðŸ‘‡

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mgfernan/gsl_uab/HEAD)

This will open a tab with Binder, a virtual environment where to launch the notebooks present in this repository.
As an alternative means to execute them, you will find `Colab` links in each notebook, which will open up a 
Google's Colab session (but you will need a Google Account to run the code)

If the Binder link seems stuck, try to clear the web browser cache (this will remove the local container image stored in the 
browser cached data)
